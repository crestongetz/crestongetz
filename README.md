## Hi there 👋
My name is Creston. I'm a **Computer Science student** passionate about using software to solve real problems and improve how people live and work.  
I believe technology will continue to revolutionize our progress as a species — and I want to be part of that evolution.

💻 **Current Focus**
- Developing **full-stack applications** using **JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL**
- Learning **DevOps practices**, CI/CD pipelines, and **cloud deployment** (AWS, Docker, Git, Linux)
- Exploring **AI/ML** through **Python**, linear algebra, statistics, and real-world API integrations

🚀 **Goal**
To build modern, reliable applications that bring together **software engineering, AI, and automation** to make a positive impact.
